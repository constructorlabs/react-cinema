# React Cinema

This was the weekend project for Week 4 of the 12 week boot camp I have been doing at Constructor Labs. Earlier in the week we had our first introduction to using React and this was our chance to put our new found powers to good use by recreating the project from the previous week which was done using vanilla js. 

The goal of the project was to implement a movie search database (with favourites) using the omdb api and React.

The core features we were asked to add were:

* Movie search
* More details when a film was selected
* Pagination where needed for search results
* Favourites (and local storage)

At this point in the course we're still on purely browser based technology so this is all running on the front-end.

A few things I wish I'd done better with this project:
* Some of the naming isn't as obvious as it could be. Another 30 mins of planning upfront could have been useful.
* There was probably more logic than neccessary in some of the componenents that could have been kept in the main App component.
* Infinite scrolling would have been nice but nothind I did seemed to make it work.

Overall I enjoyed building this project and was am pretty happy with how it turned out.
