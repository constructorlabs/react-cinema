# YETFLIX

Yetflix is an easy-to-use, minimalistic search engine for movies that is based on the Open Movie Database API. 

## How to use

Yetflix has a single page layout to make the UX as smooth as possible:

* Search box is right below the logo, with live preview functionality
* Search results are displayed below the search box and feature infinite scrolling 
* Clicking on a search result takes the user to the detailed info page for that specific movie 
* The user can then add the movie to their favourites list by clicking on the heart icon next to the movie title
* Alternatively, the imdb icon takes the user to the imdb page for that specific movie
* All favourites can be viewed by clicking on the heart icon on the top left, and their order can be changed by the arrow icons. Favourites are stored in local storage and persist browser refreshes.
* The user can clear their favourites list and reset the search results by clicking on the logout icon on the top right.
