# React Cinema

Use react to build a movie search engine using the Open Movie Database (http://www.omdbapi.com).

There are six components, with App being the parent of others.

In App, we fetch movie info and movie preview.

In Movies, we add favourite movies to localStorage.

Movie and FavMovie are the children of Movies.

Movie displays movie info and details.

FavMovie inserts a listed item in favourite list.

Search builds the search form.

Pagination works on next pages / previous pages.
